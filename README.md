# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

A professional end-to-end **Sentiment Analysis**  project that seamlessly integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** , **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** , and a **Flask-based web application** with a clean and responsive **HTML/CSS frontend. The system allows users to input text and automatically predicts the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using a trained ML model.

This repository is suitable for academic submission, portfolio presentation, and real-world demonstration.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a sentiment analysis system:

* Dataset preparation (≈ **3,000 labeled text samples**)
* Text preprocessing and feature extraction (TF-IDF)
* Machine learning model training and evaluation
* Model serialization using Pickle
* Deployment using Flask
* User-friendly web interface using HTML & CSS

Users can enter text through the website and instantly receive sentiment predictions.
